Title:
Animated Ball Moving Diagonally Across the Screen

Description:
This code creates a simple HTML page with a moving ball animation. The ball moves diagonally across the screen, bouncing back once it hits a boundary.

Files:
index.html: Contains the HTML structure and JavaScript code for the animation.
How It Works:
Styling: A div element (id="ball") is styled to resemble a ball using CSS (circular shape, violet color).
Movement Logic: The ball is animated to move diagonally across the screen using JavaScript. The position of the ball is updated at regular intervals (100ms) by modifying its top and left CSS properties.
Bouncing Effect: When the ball reaches the edges of the viewport (position >= 95% or <= 0%), it reverses its direction.
How to Run:
Save the code in an HTML file (e.g., index.html).
Open the file in a web browser.
You will see a violet ball moving diagonally and bouncing off the edges of the viewport.
